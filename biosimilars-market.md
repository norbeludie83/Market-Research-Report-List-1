<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biosimilars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombinant Non-glycosylated Proteins (Insulin, rHGH, Interferon)</li><li>Recombinant Glycosylated Proteins</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biosimilars market encompasses various types of biologic medicines designed to be similar to existing approved reference products. Recombinant non-glycosylated proteins, such as insulin and recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH), are produced using microbial systems and do not undergo glycosylation, making them simpler in structure. In contrast, recombinant glycosylated proteins, like monoclonal antibodies and erythropoietin, are produced in mammalian cells allowing for complex structures with sugar chains. Both types aim to provide cost-effective alternatives to traditional biologics.</p></p>
