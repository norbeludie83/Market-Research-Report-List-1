<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Enclosed Screw Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Screw</li><li>Multi-screw</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The enclosed screw pumps market is divided into two primary types: single screw and multi-screw pumps. Single screw pumps consist of a single helical screw, allowing for smooth fluid transfer with low pulsation, making them suitable for handling viscous fluids. Multi-screw pumps, on the other hand, utilize multiple screws working in tandem, providing higher efficiency and pressure stability, ideal for transferring lower-viscosity liquids. Both types are widely used across industries such as oil and gas, chemicals, and wastewater management.</p></p>
