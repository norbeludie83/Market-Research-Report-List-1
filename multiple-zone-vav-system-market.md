<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multiple Zone VAV System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Duct</li><li>Dual-Duct</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Multiple Zone VAV (Variable Air Volume) system market consists of two main types: Single-Duct and Dual-Duct systems. Single-Duct VAV systems deliver conditioned air through a single duct to multiple zones, allowing for individual temperature control but limited flexibility in airflow adjustments. In contrast, Dual-Duct systems utilize two separate air ductsâ€”one for hot air and one for cold. This setup provides greater flexibility and precise temperature management for each zone, making it suitable for diverse applications with varying heating and cooling needs.</p></p>
