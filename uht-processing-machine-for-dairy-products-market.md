<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UHT Processing Machine for Dairy Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct UHT Processing Machine</li><li>Indirect UHT Processing Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>UHT (Ultra-High Temperature) processing machines for dairy products are categorized into two types: direct and indirect UHT processing machines. Direct UHT processing involves injecting steam into the milk, rapidly heating it, and then cooling it quickly, which ensures sterility while preserving nutrients. In contrast, indirect UHT processing utilizes heat exchangers to transfer heat, where the milk is heated by contact with hot surfaces, reducing contamination risk but possibly affecting some sensory properties. Both methods aim to enhance shelf life and safety of dairy products.</p></p>
